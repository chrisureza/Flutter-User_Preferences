# Flutter User Preferences

These is a Flutter project that uses the shared preferences to store information to use across the app. It is setted at a settings page.

A drawer is implemented in this app and it also implements a Singleton Pattern to use only one instance of the shared preferences.

## Getting Started

This Project is based on an example made by Fernando Herrera in this course (https://fernando-herrera.com/#/curso/flutter), however the version in this repo is different from the one it is based, the code is structured differently and have some new improvements made by myself.

For help getting started with Flutter, view the
[online documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.
